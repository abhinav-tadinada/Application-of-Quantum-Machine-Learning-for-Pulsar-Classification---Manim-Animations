# Pulsar and Quantum Machine Learning Animations
# Authors - Abhinav Tadinada & Tanish Singh

This repository contains Python code for creating animations related to pulsars and quantum machine learning using the Manim library. These animations are designed to visually explain concepts in pulsar astronomy and quantum machine learning in an engaging and informative way.

## Pulsar Animations

The pulsar animations in this repository demonstrate various aspects of pulsars, including their formation, characteristics, and detection methods. These animations aim to provide an intuitive understanding of pulsars for both novice and expert audiences.

## Quantum Machine Learning Animations

The quantum machine learning animations focus on illustrating concepts at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. These animations cover topics such as quantum data flow, quantum algorithms for machine learning, and quantum neural networks. They aim to demystify complex quantum concepts and highlight their potential applications in machine learning.

## Dependencies

- Manim: The animations are created using the Manim library, an open-source animation engine for explanatory math videos.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, including Manim.
3. Navigate to the desired animation script.
4. Run the script using the Manim command-line interface (CLI) with the appropriate options.

For example, to render the Quantum Machine Learning animation script:

```bash
manim -p script_name.py PangoRender
